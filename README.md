    - [X] Bayesian optimization for AF
    - [X] Building 1D Rydberg crystals
    - [X] Microwave engineering of XXZ hamiltonian
    - [X] Preparing a state with AF coupling and Ising mode
    - [X] Shadow estimation for VQS
    - [X] 3-site XY spin chain. 
- [X] applications/QAOA and QAA to solve QUBO
- [ ] Advanced features
    - [ ] Simulation with Noise and Errors
    - [X] Register Layouts
    - [X] State preparation with the SLM Mask
