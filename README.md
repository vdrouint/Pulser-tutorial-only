    - [ ] Bayesian optimization for AF
    - [ ] Building 1D Rydberg crystals
    - [ ] Microwave engineering of XXZ hamiltonian
    - [ ] Preparing a state with AF coupling and Ising mode
    - [ ] Shadow estimation for VQS
    - [ ] 3-site XY spin chain. 
- [ ] applications/QAOA and QAA to solve QUBO
- [ ] Advanced features
    - [ ] Simulation with Noise and Errors
    - [ ] Register Layouts
    - [ ] others ...
